# FreezeLogger — SKSE Plugin Specification

**Project name:** `FreezeLogger`
**Type:** SKSE64 native DLL plugin
**Language:** C++20
**Target runtime:** Skyrim Special Edition **1.5.97** (hard-pinned)
**Engine binding:** CommonLibSSE-NG (covers 1.5.97; future SE/AE/VR support is a port, not a rebuild)
**Status:** Draft v0.6 (wires up the Papyrus VM + Animation-graph snapshot sections that were stubbed since v0.1, broadening coverage to script-side / animation freezes)

## 0. Resolved Decisions (cheat sheet)

| Branch | Decision |
|---|---|
| Audience scope | Personal-first; release on Nexus is a stretch goal |
| Target runtime | SE 1.5.97 only, runtime version verified at load |
| Engine binding | CommonLibSSE-NG via vcpkg manifest |
| Heartbeat hooks | **Dual** — `Main::Update` *and* `BSGraphics::Renderer::Present` |
| Watchdog timing | `threshold = 5000 ms`, `check = 500 ms`, `cooldown = 60 s` |
| Resolved-freeze handling | Annotate the existing report with `Resolved at T+Xs`; do not emit a duplicate |
| Mini-dump | Code in v1, **default OFF**, TOML toggleable, retain last 5 |
| Snapshot scope (v1) | §1 Header, §2 System, §3 Threads + stacks, §4 Modules, §5 Papyrus VM, §6 *lite* (player only), §7 Engine, §8 Recent-activity ring buffer |
| Snapshot additions (v0.2) | §1.5 Freeze classification (top-of-report verdict), worker-pool aggregation, Singleton-B hex-dump ASCII annotation, writer-still-live double-sample, HDT-SMP stack-presence detector, Loaded modules `FileVersion` enrichment |
| Snapshot additions (v0.3) | §6.10 Task-pool snapshot (Singleton-B layer-by-layer diff against the last healthy baseline captured at ≈1 Hz from the Main::Update hook). Designed to surface *which slot of the task pool was torn down*, so the next captured freeze can name the stuck job. |
| Deferred to v2 | §6 *full* (nearest-N actors), JSON sidecar |
| Synthetic trigger | Debug-build hotkey (`VK_PAUSE`) **+** env-var one-shot, both gated by `FL_DEBUG_TRIGGERS=ON`. Optional `FL_FAKE_HEARTBEAT=1` for testing the pipeline before hooks are pinned. |
| Symbol resolution | Microsoft public symbol server, local cache, URL embedded in every report header |
| Address Library | Hard required; plugin refuses to load on any runtime ≠ 1.5.97 |
| Source control | Local git only (no remote) |
| Test framework | Catch2 v3 (vcpkg) for unit tests; integration tests via the synthetic trigger |
| License | Deferred until / unless we publish |
| Retention | 50 text reports, 5 minidumps, unbounded symbol cache |

## 1. Problem Statement

Skyrim suffers from intermittent, non-reproducible **hard freezes**. The game becomes
fully unresponsive (no audio progression, frozen frame, no input) but the process
does not crash. Recovery requires force-killing the process.

Standard tooling does not catch this:

- **Crash loggers** only fire on access violations / unhandled exceptions; a
  frozen-but-alive process never trips them.
- **Papyrus scripts** can't reliably observe these freezes — when the engine
  stalls (native deadlock, render-thread hang, Havok stall, animgraph deadlock,
  infinite loop in a third-party DLL, memory corruption), the Papyrus VM stops
  scheduling, so a Papyrus watchdog freezes alongside the game it watches.
- **Windows Event Viewer / WER** only react after the user kills the hung
  process and produce a minidump with limited engine context.

We need an **in-process native-thread observer** that survives a stall of the
main thread and emits enough state to diagnose the cause post-mortem.

---

## 2. Goals

1. Detect when Skyrim's main thread *or* render thread has stopped advancing
   for a configurable amount of time (default: **5 s**), and identify which
   thread froze.
2. Capture a rich diagnostic snapshot from a separate native thread that is
   unaffected by the stall.
3. Persist the snapshot to disk in a human-readable format so the user can
   share it after force-quitting the game.
4. Be safe: never cause a crash, never deadlock, never measurably affect FPS
   in steady state.

## 3. Non-Goals (v1)

- Automatic recovery from the freeze.
- Replacing crash loggers for actual crashes.
- Modifying gameplay, save files, or any persistent game state.
- Fixing the underlying mod conflicts — diagnostic only.
- Cross-runtime support (SE/AE/VR). Architecture leaves the door open; v1 ships
  for 1.5.97 only.

## 4. Approach: Dual Heartbeat + Watchdog Thread

The plugin maintains **two atomic timestamps** — one updated from
`Main::Update` (game tick) and one from `IDXGISwapChain::Present`
(end-of-frame submit; we hook the DXGI swap chain directly via vtable
detour, see §5.1). A third native thread watches both:

```
   Main thread                          Render thread
   ───────────                          ─────────────
   every Main::Update:                  every Present:
     mainHeartbeat = now()                renderHeartbeat = now()
                  │                                      │
                  └────────────► both visible ◄──────────┘
                                       │
                            Watchdog thread (separate OS thread)
                            ─────────────────────────────────────
                            loop:
                              sleep(check_interval_ms)
                              age_main   = now - mainHeartbeat
                              age_render = now - renderHeartbeat
                              if max(age_main, age_render) > threshold_ms
                                 and not in cooldown:
                                  classify which thread froze first
                                  capture snapshot
                                  write report
                                  enter cooldown
                              else if frozen-thread heartbeat resumed:
                                  annotate latest report with Resolved at T+Xs
```

Why dual:

- A render-thread hang (driver wait, GPU lockup) leaves `Main::Update` ticking;
  catching this requires a `Present` heartbeat.
- A main-thread freeze (Havok / Papyrus / animgraph deadlock) usually leaves
  `Present` *also* stalled, but identifying the original culprit needs the
  classification logic.
- The report header gains a `Stalled thread:` line that is invaluable triage.

Key properties:

- Both heartbeats are `std::atomic<uint64_t>` storing `GetTickCount64()`.
  Lock-free, ~1 ns per update.
- Snapshot capture runs **on the watchdog thread**, which is healthy. It uses
  Win32 / DbgHelp APIs that operate on other threads (`SuspendThread`,
  `GetThreadContext`, `StackWalk64`).
- Snapshot is **rate-limited** by `snapshot_cooldown_s` so a permanent freeze
  doesn't generate duplicate reports.

## 5. Architecture

### 5.1 Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `PluginEntry` | SKSE plugin bootstrap, version handshake, init/shutdown |
| `Config` | Load `FreezeLogger.toml` from `Data/SKSE/Plugins/` |
| `Heartbeat` | Two atomic timestamps (`main`, `render`) + accessors |
| `MainHook` | Hooks `Main::Update`, bumps `mainHeartbeat` |
| `RenderHook` | Detours `IDXGISwapChain::Present` (vtable slot 8) after `BSGraphics::Renderer::Init_InitD3D` runs; bumps `renderHeartbeat` on every Present |
| `Watchdog` | Background thread; detects stalls; classifies; orchestrates snapshots; handles annotate-on-resolve |
| `Symbols` | DbgHelp init with MS symsrv, mutex-guarded resolver |
| `Snapshot::Threads` | Stack-walks every thread in the process |
| `Snapshot::Verdict` | Classifies the freeze at the top of the report — runs the cheap subset of `MainWaitProbe`'s detection (wait-site, Singleton-B chain, HDT-SMP stack presence, worker-pool count) and emits a single block the human reader can read first before scrolling through hundreds of KB of thread dumps. See §6.1.5. |
| `Snapshot::MainWaitProbe` | Long-form audit trail for the main thread's wait site (Singleton-A id 34554 lock primitive, or Singleton-B = Skyrim's `WaitForJobTask` helper at SkyrimSE+0xc38130 — identified by the Faster HDT-SMP-UP maintainer, see `docs/case-study/27` §0). Used to be the sole verdict surface; as of v0.2 it remains the deep-dive while `Snapshot::Verdict` lifts the headline. |
| `TaskPoolBaseline` (v0.3) | Lock-protected ring-of-1 holding the most recently captured healthy state of Skyrim's task-pool holder (Singleton-B). Written from the `Main::Update` hook on a 1-in-60 throttle (≈1 Hz at 60 fps); read by `Snapshot::TaskPool` at freeze time. Captures 32 qwords of the singleton instance, 16 qwords of the sub-array, and for each of the first 8 sub-array entries an 8-qword entry window + 8-qword handle-table window. |
| `Snapshot::TaskPool` (v0.3) | Renders the task-pool snapshot section: compares the last healthy baseline against a frozen-time capture of the same chain, with per-qword diff markers. Goal: expose which layer of the chain (global slot, singleton, sub-array, dispatch struct, handle table) was torn down between the last healthy frame and the freeze instant. See §6.10. |
| `Snapshot::Modules` | Enumerates loaded DLLs (base address, size, path, **FileVersion** as of v0.2) |
| `Snapshot::Papyrus` | Captures VM stats (v0.4): running/waiting-latent/attached-script/array/pending-func-msg/queued-unbind counts + a lock-free running-stack walk (state + freeze-state histogram). All non-locking member/`size()` reads. |
| `Snapshot::AnimGraph` | Player-only animation graph (v0.4): graph count, active index, active project name, and `hkbBehaviorGraph` activity flags. |
| `Snapshot::AnimGraph` | Captures **player-only** animation-graph state (lite) |
| `Snapshot::Engine` | Captures cell, worldspace, player position, time of day, pause flags |
| `Snapshot::System` | Captures memory, CPU load, GPU info, working set |
| `Snapshot::MiniDump` | `MiniDumpWriteDump` (default off, gated by config) |
| `RingBuffer` | Thread-safe ring of recent Papyrus log lines + SKSE messages |
| `PapyrusLogTap` | Hooks/registers as Papyrus log sink, feeds the ring buffer |
| `SkseMessageTap` | Listens on SKSE messaging interface, feeds the ring buffer |
| `Reporter` | Formats and writes the human-readable report file |
| `Logger` | Plugin's own log via `SKSE::log` (spdlog under the hood) |
| `DebugTriggers` | (compiled out unless `FL_DEBUG_TRIGGERS=ON`) hotkey + env-var synthetic stall |

### 5.2 Threading Model

- **Main thread** writes only `mainHeartbeat`. No locks on the hot path.
- **Render thread** writes only `renderHeartbeat`. No locks on the hot path.
- **Watchdog thread** is a `std::jthread` started in `kMessage_PostLoad`,
  joined on shutdown. Owns all snapshot work.
- **No re-entry**: the watchdog sets an `in_progress` flag; second triggers
  during a snapshot are coalesced.
- **DbgHelp serialization**: a single mutex inside `Symbols` guards every
  DbgHelp call (DbgHelp is not thread-safe).
- **Ring buffer**: feeders (Papyrus log tap, SKSE messaging tap) push under a
  short mutex; watchdog reads under the same mutex during snapshot.

### 5.3 Data Flow

```
[Main::Update]      ──► MainHook::tick   ──► mainHeartbeat = now
[Present]           ──► RenderHook::tick ──► renderHeartbeat = now
[Papyrus log line]  ──► PapyrusLogTap    ──► RingBuffer.push(papyrus, line)
[SKSE message]      ──► SkseMessageTap   ──► RingBuffer.push(skse, msg)
                                       │
                                       ▼
              Watchdog (every check_interval_ms):
                ages = (now - mainHeartbeat, now - renderHeartbeat)
                if max(ages) > threshold and not cooling:
                    classify (which thread crossed first / by how much)
                    Snapshot orchestrator:
                      Verdict → System → Threads → Modules
                      → Papyrus → AnimGraph → Engine
                      → MainWaitProbe → TaskPool → WaitGraph
                      → RingBuffer → MiniDump?
                    Reporter.write(report)
                    enter cooldown
                else if cooling and frozen-thread resumed:
                    Reporter.annotate_resolved(latest_report, T+Xs)

In parallel, on the main thread:
              Main::Update hook (every frame):
                Heartbeat::TickMain()
                TaskPoolBaseline::MaybeCapture()    [v0.3, throttled 1-in-60]
                ...original Main::Update...

Verdict runs first because the human reader benefits from a one-block
classification (freeze class, confidence, suggested triage doc) before
scrolling through hundreds of KB of thread dumps. Verdict is intentionally
the *cheap* subset of the diagnostics already gathered by MainWaitProbe
and WaitGraph; the long-form audit lives further down the report.
```

Output target:

```
Documents/My Games/Skyrim Special Edition/SKSE/FreezeLogger/
    freeze_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_<thread>.log         # primary report
    freeze_latest.log                             # rewritten on every snapshot
    minidumps/freeze_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.dmp        # if enabled
    symbols/                                      # MS symsrv local cache
```

`<thread>` is `main`, `render`, or `both` — matches the classification.

## 6. Diagnostics Captured per Snapshot

Section order in the report:

1. **Header**
   - Plugin name + version, build SHA, timestamp (UTC + local).
   - Skyrim runtime version, FreezeLogger config in effect.
   - `Stalled thread:` (`main` / `render` / `both`), heartbeat ages at trip
     time, configured threshold.
   - `Symbol server:` line carrying the symsrv URL string for downstream
     re-symbolication.

2. **Freeze classification** *(added in v0.2)*
   - Single block, ~10–15 lines, written immediately after the header so it
     is the first thing the human reader sees.
   - Fields:
     - `Freeze class:` — one of the recognised classes, see below.
     - `Confidence:` — `high` / `medium` / `low` based on how many of the
       fingerprint sub-checks matched.
     - `Site:` — `A` (Singleton-A id 34554 lock primitive), `B` (Singleton-B
       SkyrimSE+0xc38130 = Skyrim's `WaitForJobTask`), or `unrecognised`.
     - `Singleton-B chain:` — `intact` / `zeroed-at-step-N` / `not-walked`
       when Site == B; omitted otherwise.
     - `HDT-SMP on main stack:` — `yes (frame at hdtsmp64.dll+0xXXXXX)` /
       `no` when a frame inside `hdtsmp64.dll` is found above main's RSP.
     - `HDT-SMP worker pool:` — `N idle (all parked on hdtsmp64.dll+0xXXXXXX)`
       when `N >= 1` worker threads are sitting on the recognised
       per-worker auto-reset event RVA.
     - `Suggested triage:` — relative path to the most relevant
       `docs/case-study/*.md` for this class.
   - Recognised classes (extensible):
     - `BSSpinLock AB-BA (WorkerSpinLockFix domain)` — Site A AND a thread
       is spinning at `SkyrimSE+0x132c5a` AND the spinner's lock owner ==
       main TID. Verdict points at `docs/case-study/06-root-cause.md`.
     - `Skyrim WaitForJobTask hang (FSMP on main's stack is the upstream
       Main::Update hook, not the cause)` — Site B AND a frame inside
       `hdtsmp64.dll` is on main's stack. Per the Faster HDT-SMP-UP
       maintainer (case-study 27 §0), the FSMP frame is the upstream
       `Main::Update` hook trampoline; the actual wait is in Skyrim's
       task pool. Verdict points at `docs/case-study/27-hdtsmp-deadlock-report.md`.
     - `Skyrim WaitForJobTask hang (no HDT-SMP / FSMP frame on stack)` —
       Site B without the HDT-SMP frame; same engine wait, different
       upstream hook (or vanilla path).
     - `Site-A worker-ack wait` — Site A without the BSSpinLock cycle;
       worker did not signal completion for an unrelated reason.
     - `Unrecognised` — main is in a kernel wait we don't have a
       fingerprint for; long-form sections still emit fully.
   - The detection re-uses the cheap probes from `MainWaitProbe` (RIP/RSP
     check, Singleton-B chain walk, BSSpinLock-owner scan) — it does *not*
     duplicate the deep diagnostics. The point is to surface the verdict
     at the top of the report; the audit trail still lives in §9.

3. **System**
   - OS version, total/available RAM, page-file usage.
   - Process working set, private bytes, handle count.
   - CPU model, core count, current load.
   - GPU adapter & driver version (best-effort via DXGI).

4. **Threads**
   - For every thread: TID, OS thread name (if set via `SetThreadDescription`),
     priority, suspend count.
   - **Full call stack** with symbol resolution. The two known threads — the
     hooked `Main::Update` thread and the hooked `Present` thread — are
     labeled (`[main game thread]`, `[render thread]`) so they're trivial to
     find in the report.
   - 256-frame cap (configurable via
     `snapshot.max_frames_per_stack`; default 120 in this build),
     4096-char-per-symbol cap.
   - If the cap is reached for a thread, the section appends
     `<stack truncated: frame cap reached>` so the reader knows
     the walk is incomplete and the deeper frames were elided
     rather than absent. Threads whose `StackWalk64` terminated
     normally (walked off the bottom of the stack) do NOT emit
     this marker.

5. **Loaded modules**
   - Path, base address, size, file version (PE `VS_FIXEDFILEINFO`,
     emitted as `FileVersion=A.B.C.D` next to each row as of v0.2 — useful
     for tying a freeze to the exact build of `hdtsmp64.dll`, etc.).
   - Modules under `Data\SKSE\Plugins` are flagged so SKSE plugin DLLs are
     visible at a glance.

6. **Papyrus VM** *(wired up in v0.4)*
   - VM flags: `initialized`, `overstressed` (VM shedding load).
   - Counts read lock-free from `BSScript::Internal::VirtualMachine`
     (1.5.97 layout): running stacks (`allRunningStacks`), waiting-latent
     (`waitingLatentReturns`), attached scripts (`attachedScripts`), live
     script arrays, pending function messages (`uiWaitingFunctionMessages`
     + overflow), suspend overflow A/B, queued unbinds. All are
     `size()`-style reads (`_capacity - _free`), no map traversal, **no
     VM spinlock taken** (taking an engine lock from the watchdog thread
     would be the exact lock-order inversion the project avoids).
   - Best-effort, lock-free running-stack walk (capped at 512 visited /
     16 detailed): per-stack `stackID`, `State`, `FreezeState`, frame
     count, plus a state histogram. Racy by construction; the outer
     `Section` SEH guards any torn-map fault.
   - Diagnostic intent: a large pending-func-msg / waiting-latent backlog
     points at a **script-side** stall (runaway mod script, stuck latent
     call), distinct from the native `WaitForJobTask` hang in case-study 27.

7. **Animation graph (lite)** *(wired up in v0.4)*
   - Player only. Resolves `BSAnimationGraphManager` via
     `IAnimationGraphManagerHolder::GetAnimationGraphManager`.
   - Graph count + active graph index (`RUNTIME_DATA::activeGraph`).
   - Active `BShkbAnimationGraph`: project name, anim-bone count, foot-IK.
   - Active `hkbBehaviorGraph`: `isActive`, `isLinked`, `updateActiveNodes`,
     `stateOrTransitionChanged`, static-node count, root-generator presence.
   - Diagnostic intent: a behavior graph stuck `active=no`, or an
     unexpected/empty project on the player, can indicate an animation
     deadlock / broken behavior swap — distinct from the case-study 27 hang.

8. **Engine state**
   - Current cell + worldspace EditorIDs.
   - Player position / orientation.
   - In-game time, real time since startup.
   - Pause flags (menu open, console open, fast-travel in progress, etc.).
   - Save-blocking flags.

9. **MainWaitProbe (long-form)**
   - The deep-dive that `Verdict` (item 2) draws its headline from.
   - Walks Singleton-A field-by-field when Site A is hit; walks Singleton-B
     chain step-by-step when Site B is hit.
   - The Singleton-B instance hex dump **inline-annotates each qword that
     decodes as printable ASCII** (v0.2). The annotation is a *debug
     aid*: since v0.2.1, Singleton-B is known to be Skyrim's task-pool
     holder (not a Papyrus event-source holder), so printable bytes such
     as `"Weekday"`, `"Water"`, `"Ranged"`, `"Cast Magic Event"` may be
     coincidental ASCII inside a job-id / hash / inline padding rather
     than real engine event keys. The report prints a one-line caveat
     above the dump for the reader.
   - The **writer-still-live probe** (Site B sampled twice with a ~50 ms
     gap) lives in `Snapshot::Verdict` rather than here — it's a
     verdict-time signal, not a long-form audit signal — and its result
     is rendered as `(writer: settled)` / `(writer: still mutating)` in
     the §1.5 Freeze classification block. The MainWaitProbe section
     still walks the chain once and dumps it field-by-field.
   - BSSpinLock-owner search (Site A AB-BA cycle detection) — unchanged
     from v0.1; surfaces the lock pointer + owner TID for every spinner.
   - The **HDT-SMP stack-presence detector** also lives in `Snapshot::Verdict`
     for the same reason (cheap probe, headline-shaped output).

10. **Task-pool snapshot (v0.3)**
    - Compares the most recent **healthy baseline** (captured at ≈1 Hz from
      the `Main::Update` hook by `TaskPoolBaseline::MaybeCapture`) against
      a fresh frozen-time capture of the same chain (Singleton-B @
      `SkyrimSE+0x2f26a70` → `[+0x08]` sub-array → per-index dispatch
      struct → handle table).
    - Renders four layers, each as a baseline / frozen pair with per-qword
      `<-- DIFF` markers on lines that changed:
      - **Layer 1**: the global slot value `*(SkyrimSE+0x2f26a70)`.
      - **Layer 2**: 32 qwords of the singleton instance (with the v0.2
        ASCII annotation, caveated per case-study 27 §0 as a debug aid
        only — bytes may be coincidental ASCII inside a job-id / hash).
      - **Layer 3**: 16 qwords of the sub-array (each entry is a pointer
        to a per-queue-index dispatch struct).
      - **Layer 4**: for each populated sub-array entry, 8 qwords of the
        dispatch struct plus 8 qwords of its handle table. Frozen entries
        are matched against baseline entries by pointer so reallocated
        slots are explicitly flagged.
    - Reports the age of the baseline (`T-X.Y s before frozen capture`)
      so the analyst can see whether the chain was still healthy 1 s ago
      and torn down 200 ms ago, vs. torn down minutes earlier.
    - Includes a closing **Investigation hint** block that tells the
      analyst how to cross-reference main's wait HANDLE (from the Threads
      section) against the baseline's handle table to identify which
      queue index main was waiting on. The producer that should have
      signaled it lives somewhere in Skyrim's task pool (the FSMP
      maintainer's identification — see case-study 27 §0).
    - Cost budget: the freeze-time capture is bounded by ~256 SEH-guarded
      qword reads (singleton 32 + sub-array 16 + per-entry 8×8 + per-handle-table
      8×8 = 240). The baseline capture in `MainHook` runs the same bound
      ≈1×/s; the per-frame cost on the other 59 frames is one atomic
      increment + modulo (sub-nanosecond).

11. **WaitGraph (cross-thread)**
    - Per-handle wait table: every distinct kernel HANDLE in the process
      and the list of TIDs parked on it, plus the queried event type/state.
    - For each handle: cross-thread search for *other* threads that hold
      the handle anywhere in non-volatile registers. These are the producer
      / signaller candidates.
    - Final "classic dispatch+wait deadlock" summary when main's handle has
      zero external waiters / referencers — the smoking-gun signature of
      a Site-B orphaned wait.

12. **Recent activity (ring buffer)**
    - Last **100** Papyrus log lines (each stamped with
      `GetTickCount64()` at push time, so the gap between each
      line and the freeze instant is preserved in the report).
    - Last **50** SKSE messaging events (each stamped with
      `GetTickCount64()` at push time; type code + sender are
      captured alongside the timestamp).

13. **Mini-dump status** *(only present if mini-dump is enabled)*
   - Path, byte size, MiniDump flags actually used.
   - Failure reason if `MiniDumpWriteDump` returned an error.

Every section is wrapped in SEH + C++ exception handlers; if a section faults,
it is replaced with `<unavailable: caught SEH 0x...>` and the rest of the
report still emits. Each section flushes immediately so a force-kill mid-write
still leaves a partial-but-readable file.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### 7.1 SKSE Integration

- CommonLibSSE-NG, vcpkg manifest mode.
- `SKSEPluginVersion` declares:
  - Plugin name `"FreezeLogger"`, version follows `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD`.
  - `usesAddressLibrary = true`.
  - `compatibleVersions = { SKSE::RUNTIME_SSE_1_5_97 }`.
- Plugin load also checks the actual runtime version at startup; any mismatch
  → log error, refuse to install hooks. (Belt + braces with the
  `compatibleVersions` declaration.)

Init order:

1. `SKSEPluginLoad` → install logger, parse `FreezeLogger.toml`, init DbgHelp
   with the MS symsrv path.
2. `kMessage_PostLoad` → install both frame hooks; start the watchdog thread.
3. `kMessage_DataLoaded` → enable Papyrus snapshotter, install Papyrus log tap,
   enable animgraph lite snapshotter; start `DebugTriggers` (if compiled in).
4. On process exit / SKSE unload → request watchdog stop, join, flush logs.

### 7.2 Frame Hooks

Both hook bodies are minimal — single relaxed atomic store, then tail-call
the original via the trampoline:

```cpp
g_mainHeartbeat.store(GetTickCount64(), std::memory_order_relaxed);
return _originalMainUpdate(self, deltaTime);
```

```cpp
g_renderHeartbeat.store(GetTickCount64(), std::memory_order_relaxed);
return _originalPresent(this, syncInterval, flags);
```

Hook IDs are resolved through Address Library (`REL::ID(...)`); the exact IDs
are TBD and pinned during initial bring-up.

### 7.3 Stack Walking & Symbols

- `SymInitialize(GetCurrentProcess(), search_path, FALSE)` once at plugin load.
- `search_path` is composed as
  `"<output_dir>\\symbols;SRV*<output_dir>\\symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols"`.
- `SymSetOptions(SYMOPT_DEFERRED_LOADS | SYMOPT_FAIL_CRITICAL_ERRORS | SYMOPT_LOAD_LINES | SYMOPT_AUTO_PUBLICS)`.
- All DbgHelp calls go through `Symbols::with_lock(...)` which holds a single
  process-wide mutex.
- Per-thread walk: `OpenThread` → `SuspendThread` → `GetThreadContext` →
  `StackWalk64` loop → `ResumeThread`. Skip the watchdog's own TID.
- The plugin's own `FreezeLogger.pdb` is copied next to `FreezeLogger.dll` so
  our frames symbolicate without any download.

### 7.4 Configuration

`Data/SKSE/Plugins/FreezeLogger.toml`:

```toml
[watchdog]
threshold_ms        = 5000
check_interval_ms   = 500
snapshot_cooldown_s = 60
annotate_on_resolve = true

[snapshot]
include_threads     = true
include_modules     = true
include_papyrus     = true
include_animgraph   = true        # lite (player only) in v1
include_engine      = true
include_system      = true
include_ringbuffer  = true
max_threads         = 64

[ringbuffer]
papyrus_lines       = 100
skse_events         = 50

[minidump]
enabled             = false
flags               = "normal+threadinfo+indirect"   # or "normal" / "fullmemory"
retain_last_n       = 5

[output]
directory           = ""          # empty = Documents/My Games/.../SKSE/FreezeLogger
keep_last_n_reports = 50

[symbols]
use_ms_symbol_server = true
cache_directory      = ""         # empty = <output>/symbols

[logging]
level               = "info"      # trace | debug | info | warn | error

[test_mode]
capture_on_pause    = false       # internal/QA: on-demand report via hotkey
hotkey_vk           = 0x13        # 0x13 = VK_PAUSE
```

`[test_mode]` is a **runtime, always-compiled** developer/QA toggle (added in
0.4.0), distinct from the compile-time `FL_DEBUG_TRIGGERS` machinery in §7.7.
When `capture_on_pause = true`, `Watchdog::Start` spawns a lightweight thread
that polls `hotkey_vk` (default `VK_PAUSE`); each fresh press calls
`Reporter::CaptureManual`, which writes the full report **on demand without
stalling the game**. The report carries `Capture type: MANUAL` in its header
and is named `freeze_<ts>_manual.log`. Unlike the §7.7 debug hotkey it does
**not** induce a synthetic stall and does **not** exercise the watchdog
detection path — it is purely for eyeballing report output (Papyrus VM,
Animation graph, Task pool, …) on a live, healthy session. Default OFF; leave
off for public releases. Manual and watchdog captures are serialized by a
mutex inside the reporter.

### 7.5 Safety & Robustness

- Every snapshot routine is wrapped in **both** `__try`/`__except` (SEH) and
  `try`/`catch` so a fault in diagnostic code never takes the game with it.
- Kill-switch env var: `FL_DISABLE=1` skips watchdog start so the user can
  boot Skyrim "with the plugin installed but inert" without uninstalling.
- The plugin never writes save-game state, never modifies forms, never holds
  any RE:: pointer past the snapshot routine.
- Force-kill safety: every section flushes (`fflush` + `FlushFileBuffers`)
  immediately after writing; no more than one section's worth of data can be
  lost.

### 7.6 Performance Budget

- Steady-state per-frame cost: **< 10 ns per hook** (one relaxed atomic each).
- Watchdog wake cost: **< 50 µs every 500 ms** (default).
- Ring-buffer push cost: **< 100 ns** (mutex-guarded enqueue).
- Snapshot cost: not budgeted — only runs after the game is already frozen,
  rate-limited by `snapshot_cooldown_s`.

### 7.7 Debug Triggers (compiled out of release)

When CMake is configured with `-DFL_DEBUG_TRIGGERS=ON`:

- **Hotkey**: `VK_PAUSE`. Pressing it from the game causes the next
  `Main::Update` to `Sleep(10 * 1000)`. Heartbeat stops; watchdog trips.
- **Env vars**:
  - `FL_TEST_FREEZE_AFTER_S=N` → schedule a synthetic stall N seconds after
    `kMessage_DataLoaded`.
  - `FL_TEST_FREEZE_DURATION_S=M` → length of the stall (default 10).
  - `FL_FAKE_HEARTBEAT=1` → spawn a 10 Hz background thread that bumps
    both heartbeats on behalf of the (un-installed) hooks. Synthetic
    stalls pause this thread instead of the main game thread.
    Purpose: validate the watchdog → snapshot → reporter → retention
    pipeline before the real REL::IDs are pinned in `MainHook` /
    `RenderHook`. See the test-before-pinning workflow in `README.md`.
- Both stall paths use the same `InduceStall(seconds)` function so we
  exercise exactly one stall mechanism, regardless of mode.

## 9. Build

- **Toolchain:** Visual Studio 2022 (MSVC v143), Windows SDK 10.0.22621+,
  CMake ≥ 3.26.
- **Dependency manager:** vcpkg in **manifest mode**, `builtin-baseline`
  pinned in `vcpkg.json` for fully reproducible builds.
- **Dependencies** (`vcpkg.json`):
  - `commonlibsse-ng`
  - `spdlog` (transitive via `commonlibsse-ng`, listed explicitly for clarity)
  - `tomlplusplus`
  - `catch2` (test-only feature)
- **CMake options:**
  - `FL_DEBUG_TRIGGERS` — default `OFF`. Enables hotkey + env-var stall.
  - `FL_BUILD_TESTS` — default `ON` for local dev.
- **Output:** `FreezeLogger.dll` (Release/x64) + `FreezeLogger.pdb`.
- **PDB shipping:** PDB is copied next to the DLL during install so DbgHelp
  symbolicates our own frames without any download.

### 9.1 Local Tooling Available on the Dev Machine

These are paths on the developer workstation; document them here so future-us
(and any agent picking up the work) can resolve the open questions in §12
without re-discovering the environment.

| Tool | Path | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| **Ghidra 12.0.4** | `D:\Programme\ghidra_12.0.4` | Reverse-engineering Skyrim's binary to pin REL::IDs (`Main::Update`, `BSGraphics::Renderer::Present`); inspecting Papyrus VM internals for the log-sink hook; verifying function signatures before writing trampolines. |
| **SkyrimSE.exe (unpacked)** | `D:\SPIELE\nolvus\Instances\Nolvus Awakening\STOCK GAME\SkyrimSE.exe.unpacked.exe` | The Steam-unpacked 1.5.97 binary (decrypted, no Steam DRM stub) — the only form Ghidra can analyse cleanly. Drop this into a Ghidra project once and reuse the resulting database for every reverse-engineering session. |
| **Stock game directory** | `D:\SPIELE\nolvus\Instances\Nolvus Awakening\STOCK GAME\` | Source of `version-1-5-97-0.bin` (Address Library), reference for any other companion binaries. |

Bring-up workflow for resolving REL::IDs (§12 open question 1) — concrete
step-by-step instructions live in [`docs/ghidra-bring-up.md`](ghidra-bring-up.md).
Summary:

1. Import `SkyrimSE.exe.unpacked.exe` into a Ghidra project once; let auto-analysis finish.
2. Locate the target function (`Main::Update` / `Renderer::Present`) by RTTI,
   `WinMain` trace, or — for `Present` — by cross-referencing the
   `IDXGISwapChain::Present` import (automatable via
   `tools/ghidra/find_present_callers.py`).
3. Note the function's RVA (absolute address minus image base, `0x140000000`).
4. Plug the result into `src/MainHook.cpp` / `src/RenderHook.cpp` either as
   an Address Library ID (`REL::ID(N)`) or as a direct RVA (`REL::Offset`).
   Both code paths are already wired; pick whichever is convenient.

The Ghidra database also doubles as a forensic resource when reading freeze
reports: a stack frame at `skyrim_se.dll+0xNNNNNN` can be looked up directly
in Ghidra to identify which engine subsystem was on the stack at freeze time.

## 10. Packaging for Mod Organizer 2

A release artifact is a single **RAR** archive whose internal directory
structure is exactly what MO2 expects when you drop a mod in via
*Install a new mod from an archive*:

```
FreezeLogger_v<version>.rar
└── SKSE/
    └── Plugins/
        ├── FreezeLogger.dll
        ├── FreezeLogger.pdb
        └── FreezeLogger.toml
```

> Notes
> - Top-level folder is `SKSE/`, **not** `Data/SKSE/`. MO2 mounts the mod's
>   root onto the game's `Data/` directory.
> - Default config is included so the plugin works out of the box.
> - Address Library 1.5.97 is a runtime dependency; we declare this in the
>   release notes, we do not bundle it.
> - The PDB is in the archive (~1 MB) so the user's own frames symbolicate.

`packaging/make_release.ps1`:

1. Build Release/x64 via CMake.
2. Stage the tree under `build/stage/SKSE/Plugins/`.
3. Copy `FreezeLogger.dll`, `FreezeLogger.pdb`, `dist/FreezeLogger.toml`
   into the stage.
4. Invoke `rar.exe a -r -m5 FreezeLogger_v<ver>.rar SKSE` from the stage dir.

Personal-first note: while we're not publishing yet, we still keep the
packaging script in-repo so the muscle memory exists when we do.

## 11. Validation Plan

1. **Synthetic stall — hotkey path**
   - Build with `-DFL_DEBUG_TRIGGERS=ON`.
   - Boot Skyrim, load any save.
   - Press `VK_PAUSE`. The next `Main::Update` sleeps 10 s.
   - Within `5000 + 500 ms` the watchdog must produce
     `freeze_<ts>_main.log` with non-empty Threads/Modules/Papyrus sections.

2. **Synthetic stall — env-var path**
   - Launch with `FL_TEST_FREEZE_AFTER_S=30 FL_TEST_FREEZE_DURATION_S=10`.
   - Confirm an unattended freeze + report after `kMessage_DataLoaded + 30 s`.

3. **Resolve annotation**
   - Use a 10 s synthetic stall; confirm the report grows a
     `Resolved at T+10.x s` line and that **no second report file** appears
     (only the existing one is annotated).

4. **Real-freeze regression**
   - Once a real organic freeze is captured, verify the report contains:
     (a) a non-trivial main-thread stack with at least one symbolicated
     `ntdll!` / `kernel32!` frame, (b) a populated module list,
     (c) Papyrus VM stats, (d) system memory line, (e) 100 ring-buffer
     Papyrus lines.

5. **No false positives**
   - Long load screens, alt-tab, and the in-game menu must not trip the
     watchdog. (Hooking `Main::Update` should make this automatic — both
     menus and load screens still call `Main::Update`.)

6. **Stability soak**
   - 24 h of normal play with `level = "debug"`. Acceptance criteria:
     zero crashes, < 5 MB plugin log, no measurable FPS regression
     (≤ 0.5 % in a fixed benchmark scene).

7. **Verdict classification (v0.2)**
   - For each historical freeze report in
     `docs/case-study/27-hdtsmp-deadlock-report.md`'s data set, replay
     against the current build (or, if replay is not available, manually
     compare): the Verdict block must classify the freeze as
     `Skyrim WaitForJobTask hang (FSMP on main's stack is the upstream
     Main::Update hook, not the cause)` and the suggested triage link
     must resolve.
   - For a synthetic Site-A freeze (constructed via the test harness in
     `skyrim-freeze-fix`), Verdict must classify `BSSpinLock AB-BA` and
     point at `06-root-cause.md`.
   - For the synthetic stall path (no real bug class), Verdict must classify
     `Unrecognised` and not lie about a fingerprint match.

8. **Task-pool snapshot (v0.3)**
   - With `-DFL_DEBUG_TRIGGERS=ON`, boot Skyrim, load a save, idle for
     ≥ 2 s (so `TaskPoolBaseline::MaybeCapture` runs at least once), then
     trigger a synthetic stall via `VK_PAUSE`.
   - The resulting `freeze_<ts>_main.log` must contain a `Task pool snapshot`
     section with: (a) a non-zero `Last healthy baseline captured` age, (b)
     the four-layer baseline / frozen comparison, and (c) the
     `Investigation hint` footer.
   - On a real-world WaitForJobTask freeze (e.g. another instance of the
     case-study 27 corpus), the baseline must show a populated sub-array
     while the frozen sample shows `null` or a torn-down value, with
     `<-- DIFF` markers on the affected qwords.
   - No crash, no hang, no measurable per-frame overhead (≤ 0.5 % FPS
     delta in the soak scene from §11.6).

9. **Unit tests (Catch2)**
   - `Heartbeat`: atomic store/load semantics, monotonicity.
   - `Watchdog`: stall detection given mocked clock + heartbeat;
     cooldown semantics; resolve-annotation logic.
   - `RingBuffer`: thread-safe push/snapshot, ordering, capacity bound.
   - `Verdict::Classify` (v0.2): given a synthesised
     `Verdict::Observations` POD (Site A/B flags, Singleton-B chain state,
     HDT-SMP frame presence, worker-pool count, BSSpinLock cycle flag),
     the classifier returns the expected `Verdict::Class` enum and
     confidence for every recognised class. Pure function, no game-state
     dependency, ideal for table-driven testing.

---

## 12. Open Questions (still to resolve during bring-up)

- **REL::IDs for the two hook targets — RESOLVED for 1.5.97.** Cross-verified
  against two independent commits of `doodlum/skyrim-community-shaders`
  (`08286310`, `783f5024`):
  - `RE::Main::Update` CALL site → `REL::ID(35551)`, offset `0x11F`
    (call-site inside the WinMain main loop; canonical NG idiom is
    `stl::write_thunk_call` rather than entry detour).
  - `BSGraphics::Renderer::Init_InitD3D` CALL site → `REL::ID(75595)`,
    offset `0x50` (used to defer install of the swap-chain detour).
  - `IDXGISwapChain::Present` → vtable slot 8 (Microsoft DXGI contract;
    no REL::ID needed, no Address Library dependency for this hop).
  Pinned values live in `src/MainHook.cpp` and `src/RenderHook.cpp` with
  inline citations. If a future runtime is targeted, see
  `docs/ghidra-bring-up.md`.
- **Papyrus log interception mechanism**: prefer registering as a
  `BSScript::ILogEventSink` if CommonLibSSE-NG exposes it; otherwise hook
  `BSScript::Internal::VirtualMachine::TraceStack`/log emission. Decide
  during PapyrusLogTap implementation. Verify the chosen vtable slot in
  Ghidra if the CommonLibSSE-NG headers are ambiguous.
- **AnimGraph lite accessor — RESOLVED (v0.4).** Uses
  `IAnimationGraphManagerHolder::GetAnimationGraphManager` →
  `BSAnimationGraphManager::graphs[RUNTIME_DATA::activeGraph]` →
  `BShkbAnimationGraph` (`projectName`, `behaviorGraph`). Verified against
  the CommonLibSSE-NG 1.5.97 headers shipped by the vcpkg port. The "current
  animation event / time-in-state" sub-items were dropped from the lite
  scope: extracting them requires walking the `hkbBehaviorGraph` state
  machine (Havok internals), which is the footgun-prone traversal §13
  defers. The wired-up section reports the behavior-graph activity flags
  instead, which answer the "is the graph wedged?" question without the
  deep walk.
- **Papyrus VM stats — RESOLVED (v0.4).** Counts + running-stack walk read
  directly from the `VirtualMachine` 1.5.97 layout, lock-free. (The Papyrus
  *log* interception item below is separate and already handled by
  `PapyrusLogTap`.)

The remaining items are *implementation* unknowns, not architectural ones,
and shouldn't gate the rest of the work.

---

## 13. Deferred to v2 / Future Extensions

| Item | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| **Cross-runtime support (AE, VR)** | Single target keeps v1 small; CommonLibSSE-NG already abstracts most differences |
| **Animation-graph snapshot for nearest-N actors** | Havok behavior-graph traversal is footgun-prone; player-only answers most freeze questions |
| **JSON sidecar** | Low value for a personal tool; trivial to add later if a downstream tool wants it |
| **Live overlay** (ImGui heartbeat dashboard) | Pure quality-of-life; not diagnostic |
| **Auto-classification of likely culprit DLL** | Needs a corpus of freeze reports first |
| **Crash-logger interop** | Suppress our snapshot if CrashLoggerSSE handler fired in last second; needs cross-plugin coordination |
| **Public README + Nexus page** | Defer until v1 has caught a real freeze |
